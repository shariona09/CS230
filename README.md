## Client Overview

The Gaming Room is a client that wanted to expand their game *Draw It or Lose It* from Android to multiple platforms. They required a scalable, well-structured software design that would support consistent game logic and performance across devices.

## Design Reflection

In developing the design document, I did well in organizing the software architecture and choosing appropriate design patterns such as Singleton and Iterator. These helped manage shared game state and user interactions efficiently. Having the design in place before writing code made development smoother, since I had a clear understanding of component responsibilities and interactions.

If I were to revise one part, I would enhance the domain model diagrams by including clearer labels and multiplicities to improve readability for developers.

I translated the client’s needs into specific features and components, ensuring the design stayed focused on usability and the player experience. Considering user needs is essential—it ensures that the software is not only functional but also valuable.

My approach to the design was top-down, starting with high-level architecture and refining it into detailed components. In future projects, I’ll continue to use UML diagrams, user stories, and proven design patterns to create scalable, maintainable software systems.
